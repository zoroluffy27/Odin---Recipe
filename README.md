This is the first I am undertaking as a part of the ODIN Project. I 
have learnt the basics of HTML and I will be demonstrating the same 
by means of creating this project. I will come back to this project once I learn CSS.

Things I have learnt and will be showcasing:
1. The basic DOCTYPE
2. setting the language
3. Having diferrent headings,lists, links and images.
