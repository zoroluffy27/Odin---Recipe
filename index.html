    <h1>Odin Recipes</h1>
<p>This is the homepage of my first project website on Recipes. The website was only designed using HTML when I was yet to learn CSS. Modifications (if any) as per CSS have been performed after I carried on forward with learning CSS and was prompted to revisit the project and apply what I have learnt under the CSS course.</p><br>
