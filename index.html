    <h1>Odin Recipes</h1>
<p>This is the homepage of my first project website on Recipes. The website was only designed using HTML when I was yet to learn CSS. Modifications (if any) as per CSS have been performed after I carried on forward with learning CSS and was prompted to revisit the project and apply what I have learnt under the CSS course.</p>

<p>This webpage contains direct links to the recipe pages of the mentioned dishes. They are:</p>
<ol>
    <li><a href="recipes/lasagna.html"><strong>Lasagna</strong></a></li>
    <li><a href="recipes/pizza-from-naples.html"><strong>Pizza from Naples</strong></a></li>
    <li><a href="recipes/indian-curry.html"><strong>Indian Curry</strong></a></li>
    </ol>
